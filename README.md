# NovaSwap™
 NovaSwap™ is a powerful DeFi multichain protocol, that allows users to manage their assets on several different networks. It uses Moralis, and is expected that in the future it will be possible to use it with Solana and other non-EVM networks, but for the time being, you can only use it with EVMs.

 Our code is open source, under the MIT Licence, so feel free to fork and make your changes to it.
